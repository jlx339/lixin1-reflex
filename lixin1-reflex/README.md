This is a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use reaction timer and gameshow buzzer application. Gameshow buzzers are used on shows like Jeopardy to determine who gets to answer a question by who pressed the buzzer button first. Reaction timers are used to train for such shows so that you can press the buzzer button fast to answer the question.
